## What is this

Time Billing for Claude Code does the job you pay Harvest for, as a Postgres database and a set of Claude Code commands. There is no web front end. You open the folder in [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and ask for what you want in plain language. It runs the right query, and it can answer questions the Harvest dashboard cannot.

<!-- TODO(author): two or three sentences on what this specific product covers and who it is for. -->

## Why no front end

- The front end was only ever there because the database was hard to talk to. That is no longer true.
- Your data sits in plain Postgres tables you own. Any tool can read them. No export, no lock-in.
- No seats, no tiers, no add-ons. Read [docs/why-no-front-end.md](docs/why-no-front-end.md) for the honest trade-offs too.

## Quick start

Sixty seconds, no database install (an embedded Postgres runs inside Node):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Enterprise-DNA-OS/time-billing-for-claude-code.git
cd time-billing-for-claude-code
npm install
npm run demo
```

Then open the folder in Claude Code and type a slash command. <!-- TODO(author): name the first command to try. -->

### Use it with your own Postgres or Supabase

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set `DATABASE_URL`, then `npm run migrate`. Same commands, shared data, no per-seat fee.

## The commands

<!-- TODO(author): a table of the slash commands in .claude/commands and what each one does. -->

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/...` | ... |

## Instead of harvest

<!-- TODO(author): how to bring data across from Harvest; link docs/replace-harvest.md -->

## Built with Claude Code

This repository was built with Claude Code as the primary development tool, from the schema to the commands, and it is meant to be extended the same way. Ask for a new command and it writes one.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Keep the shape: plain SQL, a small CLI, a slash command per recurring job, no front end.

## Want it installed and run for you?

Enterprise DNA installs Time Billing for Claude Code for your business, migrates your Harvest data, connects it to the rest of your tools, and runs it for you as part of **Omni**, our managed Command Center. One setup fee, then a monthly retainer.
